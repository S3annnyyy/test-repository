User: hows the weather like in singapore
Bot: I don't have real-time data access to provide current weather conditions. However, Singapore typically has a tropical rainforest climate, characterized by high humidity and temperatures averaging around 25-31°C (77-88°F) throughout the year. Rainfall is common, especially during the monsoon seasons. For the latest weather updates, I recommend checking a reliable weather website or app. If you have any other questions or need assistance with something else, feel free to ask!
User: can you give me code to call weather api
Bot: Sure! Below is an example of how to call a weather API using Python with the `requests` library. This example uses the OpenWeatherMap API, which requires an API key. Make sure to sign up for an API key if you don't have one.

Here's the code:

{python}
```python
import requests

def get_weather(city, api_key):
    base_url = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
    params = {
        'q': city,
        'appid': api_key,
        'units': 'metric'  # Use 'imperial' for Fahrenheit
    }
    
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        main = data['main']
        weather = data['weather'][0]
        
        print(f"City: {data['name']}")
        print(f"Temperature: {main['temp']}°C")
        print(f"Weather: {weather['description']}")
    else:
        print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)

# Example usage
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  # Replace with your actual API key
city = 'Singapore'
get_weather(city, api_key)
```

### Instructions:
1. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
2. You can change the `city` variable to any city you want to check the weather for.
3. Run the code, and it will print the current temperature and weather description for the specified city.

Make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't done so:

```bash
pip install requests
```
